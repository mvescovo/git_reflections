What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the git hidden folder which contains meta data about the
repository. It does not include any commits, you need to create the first
commit manually with an appropriate description.

I need to do it so that git knows about the files in the directory and can
track changes etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is for files that you want to track to be later commited to
the repository. The working directory contains all files in the currently
checked out version of the repository. The repository contains all versions.
